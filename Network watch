To verify traffic routing through Network Watcher, you can use the **Effective Routes** and **Connection Monitor** tools within Network Watcher. Here’s a step-by-step guide for checking if traffic is following the correct path through the Zscaler Cloud Connector.

### Step 1: Verify Effective Routes in Network Watcher
The **Effective Routes** tool helps verify that the route configuration is correctly set up for each VM’s network interface (NIC).

1. **Go to Network Watcher**:
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to **Network Watcher**.
   - Select **Effective Routes** under **Network Diagnostic Tools**.

2. **Select the Target VM**:
   - Choose the **Subscription** and **Region** where your VM is located.
   - Under **Network Interface**, select the NIC of the VM from one of your VNETs (e.g., identity, management, shared, or backup).

3. **View the Effective Route Table**:
   - Network Watcher will display the effective routes for the selected NIC.
   - Look for the route with the **Destination** `0.0.0.0/0` (representing internet-bound traffic).
   - **Next Hop**: Ensure that this route directs traffic to the **Next Hop IP** associated with your Zscaler Cloud Connector (usually the IP address of the Zscaler load balancer or endpoint). 

   This confirms that internet-bound traffic from this VM is routed through the Zscaler Cloud Connector.

### Step 2: Use Connection Monitor in Network Watcher (Optional)
**Connection Monitor** allows you to actively monitor traffic paths between VMs and external destinations, such as public IPs.

1. **Set Up Connection Monitor**:
   - In Network Watcher, go to **Connection Monitor**.
   - Click on **+ Add** to create a new Connection Monitor instance.

2. **Configure the Connection**:
   - **Source**:
     - Select a VM in one of your VNETs as the source (e.g., a VM in the identity or management VNET).
   - **Destination**:
     - Set an external IP (e.g., `8.8.8.8` or any internet address) as the destination to check if traffic is flowing through Zscaler.
   - **Protocol**: Choose **TCP** or **ICMP** for the test.

3. **Review Monitoring Results**:
   - Once created, Connection Monitor will periodically test and log the connection.
   - Check for the **latency**, **hops**, and **Next Hop** information to ensure that traffic to external IPs is routed through the Zscaler IP as expected.

### Step 3: Review Network Security Group (NSG) Flow Logs (if enabled)
If NSG flow logs are enabled, they can provide an additional layer of verification by showing inbound and outbound traffic flows.

1. **Enable NSG Flow Logs**:
   - In the Network Watcher settings, go to **NSG Flow Logs** and enable it for the NSG associated with the subnet where the VM resides.
   - Set **Storage Account** and **Log Analytics Workspace** where logs should be stored.

2. **Analyze Flow Logs**:
   - After a few minutes, check the flow logs in the storage account or Log Analytics.
   - Look for outbound traffic from your VM with a destination of `0.0.0.0/0`, and verify that the logs indicate traffic is routed to Zscaler’s IP.

### Summary
Using **Effective Routes** confirms that route tables are applied correctly, while **Connection Monitor** actively verifies the traffic path. Combined, these tools ensure that internet-bound traffic is routed as intended through Zscaler. Let me know if you need more clarification on any specific step within Network Watcher!
